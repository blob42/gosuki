.SH SEARCH SYNTAX

All search commands accept a search term and optional tag filters. 
The search term can comprise multiple words, they will be matched as is against the URL and Title fields.
Search terms come before filters.

Tag filters start with a colon (:) followed by a comma-separated list of tags.
Tags are boolean (AND) by default, meaning all specified tags must be present for a bookmark to match.
To use OR logic between tags, prefix the tag filter with ":OR" followed by space-separated tag names.
