.SH SEARCH SYNTAX

All search commands accept a search term and optional tag filters. The search
term can comprise multiple words, they will be matched as is against the URL and
Title fields. Search terms come before filters.

Tag filters start with a colon (:) followed by a comma-separated list of tags.
Tags are boolean (AND) by default, meaning all specified tags must be present
for a bookmark to match. To use OR logic between tags, prefix the tag filter
with ":OR" followed by comma-separated tag names.
