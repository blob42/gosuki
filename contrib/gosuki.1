.TH GOSUKI 1 "2025" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
gosuki \- A real-time, multi-browser bookmark manager with modular
architecture and P2P sync. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B gosuki
[OPTION...] [COMMAND... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Gosuki is a modular standalone and extension-free bookmark management system
that centralizes and synchronizes bookmarks across multiple browsers and
devices. It operates as a lightweight background service (daemon) that
monitors native browser bookmark files (e.g., Firefox's \f(CWplaces.sqlite\fR,
Chrome's Bookmarks json files) using OS-level file system watchers,
eliminating the need for browser extensions.
.PP
Gosuki features real-time monitoring of bookmark changes via inotify/kqueue,
ensuring zero latency in updates. It supports a tagging system that
automatically flattens folder hierarchies into tag-based metadata (e.g.,
\f(CW#work\fR for "Work/Projects"). 

.PP
Since Gosuki does not rely on browser extensions, it can theoretically support
any browser or API that emits bookmark-like data. Currently it supports
browsers in the Firefox or Chrome family and has custom support for
Qutebrowser.
.PP
Bookmarks are stored in a sqlite3(1) database at
\fI$XDG_DATA_DIR/gosuki/gosuki.db\fR with a Buku-compatible (see \fBBUKU\fR)
schema to ensure interoperability. Gosuki can handle multiple browser profiles
for each
monitored browser by detecting and aggregating bookmarks into a unified view.


.SS Synchronization 
.PP
Gosuki offers a two methods to synchronize your bookmarks between multiple
Gosuki nodes: a real-time automated P2P sync mechanism (Gosuki+), and
Syncthing as an alternative method for syncing basic bookmark metadata.


.SS Importing
.PP
Gosuki provides multiple import methods to migrate bookmarks from external
sources into its unified database. These methods include one-time imports via
CLI commands and automatic HTML bookmark file monitoring. See to the \fB
IMPORTING\fR and \fB HTML AUTOIMPORT\fR sections for more details.

.SH BUKU
Gosuki is interoperable with Buku programs, allowing any Buku tool to
access the Gosuki database directly. However, Gosuki cannot directly access
Buku databases and requires explicit migration using the command \fBgosuki
import buku\fR to convert existing Buku data into Gosuki's format.

.SH IMPORTING
Gosuki automatically watches all browsers in real time and does not require
manual importing, but also offers ways to migrate bookmarks from external
sources into its unified database.

Gosuki provides multiple import methods including one-time imports via CLI
commands and automatic HTML bookmark file monitoring.

The \fBgosuki import\fR command serves as the primary interface for importing
bookmarks from various external sources.

.SH HTML AUTOIMPORT
The HTML autoimport feature allows Gosuki to automatically detect and import
bookmarks from HTML files in user-defined directories. This is particularly
useful for syncing browser-generated bookmark exports (e.g., Firefox's HTML
bookmarks).

To enable HTML autoimport, configure the \fB[html-autoimport]\fR section in
the config file (\fI$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/gosuki/config.toml\fR):

.RS
.nf
[html-autoimport]
    paths = ["$HOME/shares/bookmarks"]
.fi
.RE

.TP
.B paths
A list of directories to monitor for HTML bookmark files. Supports environment
variable expansion (e.g., \fI~/shares/bookmarks\fR).
