<h3 align="center">What's this ? Oh, just another bookmark manager. No big deal.</h3>

- [x] Ever feel like your bookmarks are a [chaotic mess](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13734253) ?
- [x] Ever find yourself swapping browsers when they [stop meeting](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/wiki/About-Google-Chrome's-%22This-extension-may-soon-no-longer-be-supported%22) your demands ?
- [x] Have past bookmark managers [let you down](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket), vendor locking or abandoning you in your time of need ?
- [x] Would you rather avoid entrusting your bookmarks to cloud companies and [browser extensions](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/browser-extensions-turn-nearly-1-million-browsers-into-website-scraping-bots/) ?
- [x] Perhaps you keep multiple browser profiles for work, research, streaming, and development ?
- [x] Do you use some [‚Äúobscure‚Äù](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) browser that doesn't support extensions ?

- [ ] If you're nodding your head to any of the above, then look no further:

**GoSuki** is a cloudless, **extension-free**, **multi-browser**, and **real time** bookmark tracker and organizer. It packs everything in a **single binary** and captures all your bookmarks in a **portable database** with [multi-device sync](https://gosuki.net/docs/features/multi-device-sync/) capability. It will eventually support [every internet browser under the sun](#how-does-it-work-).

## Installation


Checkout the [quick start guide](https://gosuki.net/docs/getting_started/quickstart).

Gosuki currently supports Linux and MacOS<sub>beta</sub> . More platforms are [planned](#roadmap).

### Packages

<div align="center">
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gosuki-git"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch-AUR-blue?logo=archlinux"></a>
</div>


### From source

##### Dependencies:

- `sqlite3` development library

```shell
go install github.com/blob42/gosuki/cmd/gosuki@latest
```

- Build with systray icon feature

```shell
go install -tags systray github.com/blob42/gosuki/cmd/gosuki@latest
```

#### optional `suki` cli command

`suki` is a cli command to list/filter bookmarks with a customizable dmenu/rofi compatible output

```shell
go install github.com/blob42/gosuki/cmd/suki@latest
```

## Running GoSuki

GoSuki is designed to run as a background service for real-time bookmark monitoring. Below are the recommended ways to start and interact with the application.

### As a Service
Start GoSuki as a persistent service ([systemd example](contrib/gosuki.service)):
```bash
gosuki start
```
This initializes all configured browsers and begins real-time bookmark tracking.

### Terminal UI (TUI)
Launch with an interactive terminal interface for real-time parsing overview:
```bash
gosuki --tui start
```
The TUI displays module status and bookmark processing metrics.

### Importing bookmarks

#### From Buku

```shell
gosuki import buku
```

This will imports all bookmarks from Buku into Gosuki. Gosuki DB is compatible with buku, meaning you can symlink gosuki DB or add it to Buku and it will just work. However, gosuki cannot read a buku database unless it is imported with the above command.

#### From pocket

Import bookmarks from a Pocket export in `csv` format:

```shell
gosuki import pocket export_file.csv
```

### Debugging
A leveled logging system is available with `--debug={trace,debug,info,warn,error,fatal,none}`

```bash
gosuki --debug=info 

## Set debug level per subsystem
gosuki --debug=info,chrome=trace
```

*note* use `--debug=list` to list the available levels and subsystems

## How does it work ?

Gosuki monitors the browser's internal bookmark files for changes. It uses the native OS event notification system to detect changes as they happen. This allows it to be fast and efficient, without the need for any plugins or extensions. This architecture makes it possible to load bookmarks from any kind of internet browser, API or program that emits something akin to a bookmark.

The application maintains a **local** portable database of all tracked bookmarks, accessible via the built-in web UI or CLI.

## Rationale

I spent years working on and off on this project. My goal was to create a bookmark management solution resilient to vendor lock-in and the increasing trend of subscription services seeking rent for access to our curated internet content.

In the age of the "everything internet" web links and bookmarks represent a significant investment of human time spent curating and selecting relevant content. The past decade has seen a noticeable ~enshittification~ decline in the quality of internet results, with SEO-optimized blogs, marketing materials, and censored links making it increasingly difficult to find valuable websites and articles. Now with the advent of AI-generated ‚Äúslop‚Äù and low-quality content, we face an  endless stream of potentially  fake and unreliable information.

GoSuki is my modest attempt to make the definitive solution for managing internet bookmarks that is: browser and platform agnostic, immune to vendor lock-in and fully self contained. The extension-free architecture of gosuki means that eventually every internet browser under the sun will be supported.
