- [x] Maybe you would rather avoid entrusting your bookmarks to cloud companies.
- [x] Perhaps you keep multiple browser profiles for work, research, streaming, and development?

## Installation

Checkout the [quick start guide](https://gosuki.net/docs/getting_started/quickstart).

### Releases


#### From source

##### Dependencies:

- `sqlite3` development library

```console
 go install github.com/blob42/gosuki/cmd/gosuki@latest
 go install github.com/blob42/gosuki/cmd/suki@latest
```

Gosuki currently supports Linux and MacOS<sub>beta</sub> . More platforms are [planned](#roadmap).

## Running GoSuki

GoSuki is designed to run as a background service for real-time bookmark monitoring. Below are the recommended ways to start and interact with the application.

### As a Service
Start GoSuki as a persistent service:
```bash
gosuki start
```
This initializes all configured browsers and begins real-time bookmark tracking.

### Terminal UI (TUI)
Launch with an interactive terminal interface for real-time parsing overview:
```bash
gosuki --tui start
```
The TUI displays module status and bookmark processing metrics.

### Debugging
Enable detailed logging with:
```bash
gosuki --debug=2
```
*note*: Avoid using `--tui` with debug mode.

## How does it work ?

Gosuki monitors the browser's internal bookmark files for changes. It uses the native OS event notification system to detect changes as they happen. This allows it to be fast and efficient, without the need for any plugins or extensions.

The application maintains a portable database of all tracked bookmarks, accessible via the built-in web UI or CLI.
